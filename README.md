# Mastodon Archive Viewer - Zero’s fork

An offline web page to view a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) archive. It gives a powerful data table to tell you what the composition of all your toots is. There is also a line graph telling you the tooting trend. You can select a period of time to view.

It is not fair to exclude them.
* 08/13/2021, Zero
    * add debug mode

* 12/30/2021, Zero
    * add a solution for outdated browsers (thanks to @10thousandmilescantbebroken)
* 02/10/2022, Zero
    * check the existence of key “address_img” before getting it, fixing the missing file problem which could be caught by not packaged correctly. (thanks to @mionemrys)
    * add the audio template and support more attachments’ types. (thanks to @mionemrys)

## Usage:
Simply put, just request your Mastodon archive and download it, save this repo, open the `archive_page.html` web page in your browser and choose your archive, there you go.

### Linux:
First go to your Mastodon instance, request an archive of your toots and uploaded media (Settings - Import and export - Data export), and download your archive. Then:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zero-mstd/mav-z.git
$ cd mav-z
$ firefox archive_page.html
```

### Windows:
1. First go to your Mastodon instance, request an archive of your toots and uploaded media (Settings - Import and export - Data export), and download your archive;
2. Open this link <https://github.com/zero-mstd/mav-z/tree/master> in a browser;
3. Hit the green button `Code`;
4. Choose `Download ZIP`;
5. Unzip what you downloaded (should be `mav-z-master.zip`) and enter this folder;
6. Open the `archive_page.html` in your browser;
7. Follow the instructions, choose and open the entire `.tar.gz` archive file you got from the 1st step.

## Troubleshooting:
### If your archive file is too big:
This web page tool can automatically decompress the `archive-xxx.tar.gz` file for you, and it will store all the decompressed files in memory (RAM) temporarily. For reference, my archive file is about 200 MB and it will take 5 seconds to finish all the works.

If your archive file is too big (I don't know, maybe > 1000 MB), your browser may get stuck. In this case, using the **manual mode** is a good idea, i.e., unzipping the archive file manually by yourself. In order to display media files correctly, you should copy and paste your files so that your directory tree is like:

```bash
./
├── actor.json
├── archive_page.html
├── assets
│   ├── avatar.png
│   ├── chart.js
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── header.jpg
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── pako.min.js
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── translator.js
│   └── untar.js
├── bookmarks.json
├── likes.json
├── media_attachments
│   └── files
│       ├── ……
│       └── ……
└── outbox.json
```

Now you can open the `archive_page.html` in your browser, choose `manually` in the `Loading mode` drop-down menu, then follow the instructions, choose and open the four `.json` files one by one. `actor.json` must be loaded before `outbox.json`, while `bookmarks.json` and `likes.json` are optional.

### If your toots are not in order:
If your toots are not arranged completely in chronological order, as shown below, this may be caused by some kind of unknown bug. (If you can figure it out please let me know.)

![One misplaced January toot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zero-mstd/figure-bed@master/example.png "One misplaced January toot")

Here is the workaround: open and edit the `assets/main.js`, go to **line 431** and remove the first two slashes.
```javascript
/* 428 */    var statuses = outbox.orderedItems.map(item => item.object)
/* 429 */        .filter(object => typeof(object) === typeof({}));
/* 430 */    // Uncomment the following line to sort your toots by published time.
/* 431 */    statuses = statuses.sort((a,b) => new Date(a.published).getTime() - new Date(b.published).getTime());
/* 432 */    debugLog("(log)(build) turned outbox.orderedItems to statuses");
```

By the way, if you want to view your toots in reverse order, edit **line 431** like this (exchange `a` and `b` in the first bracket):
```javascript
/* 431 */    statuses = statuses.sort((b,a) => new Date(a.published).getTime() - new Date(b.published).getTime());
```

### If your browser is too old:
The line graph function depends on [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), whose support for older browsers got dropped a while back. Thus, this tool supports:
- Chrome >= 64
- Edge >= 79
- Firefox >= 69
- Opera >= 51

If your browser doesn’t meet the minimum version number mentioned above, you should get error like “ReferenceError: ResizeObserver is not defined”. If this happens, upgrading your browser is always the best choice. But if you can’t upgrade for some reasons, you can also delete line 336 and line 338 in `archive_page.html`:
```html
<!--336-->    <!--
<!--337-->    <script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/polyfillResizeObserver.js"></script>
<!--338-->    -->
```

### Other problems:
If you run into other problems, here's what you can do:

1. Open the `assets/main.js`;
2. Edit it, change the 2nd line to `var debug = 1;`, which means you turn on the debug mode;
3. Open the `archive_page.html` in browser;
4. Press the `F12` button and go to the `console` tab, make sure you have already seen the log “debug mode on”;
5. Now do the process normally;
6. Analyze the log to see if you can find the cause to the problem;
7. Solve it if you can! Feel free to fork or open a PR;
8. If you have no clue, you can contact me via Mastodon or raise a issue. Don't forget to provide your log.

- [ ] total(with_reply_ct) + boost_ct - direct_ct != display_ct, why?
- [x] i18n support. use pure js, with data attributes. see [this link](https://codeburst.io/translating-your-website-in-pure-javascript-98b9fa4ce427)
- [x] more information? for example, the one you liked the most, the one you boost the most…
- [x] add a line graph, maybe?
- [x] time zone problem
- [ ] optimize the ram usage, take care about memory leaks/bloat, see [this article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/)
